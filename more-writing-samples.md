# More Writing Samples

When support began receiving feedback that there was confusion about the best way to begin using the new platform, I created this section to help guide the overall process:

* [Best Way to Start](https://docs.swimlane.com/turbine/best-way-to-start/best-way-to-start.htm)

Building playbooks (for new end-users) can be tricky in a new platform. To reduce confusion, I start off with the landing page that explains what playbooks are, their architectural structure, and then all the children pages walk the user through building their playbook.

## Use Cases

Use cases were born from feedback directly from field support. I would regularly ask them what their top questions from customers were, and I would create use cases to walk end-users through those scenarios, so that when someone called support, all the support person had to do was provide a link. This was to save effort on the part of the customer and field support.
